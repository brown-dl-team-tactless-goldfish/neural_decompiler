## Contributors
NeuralDecompiler was built by [Andrew Yang](https://github.com/ajy25), [Tiger Ji](https://github.com/taiga-forestry), [Frank Chiu](https://github.com/frankchiu12), and [Justin Cheng](https://github.com/jqhc) to fulfill the final project requirement of [CSCI 1470/2470 - Deep Learning](https://brown-deep-learning.github.io/dl-website-s23/), which was taught by Professor Ritambhara Singh at Brown University. 

Andrew Yang contributed to the preprocessing and tokenization of training data. Andrew also implemented the transformer model.

Tiger Ji contributed to the compiling process of C to Assembly as well as the cleaning of C and Assembly files. Tiger also wrote the script to rename function, struct, and variable names in the C files. 

Frank Chiu contributed to the scraping of Leetcode C user solutions. Frank also contributed to the renaming process of function, struct, and variable names in the C files. 

Justin Cheng contributed to the ChatGPT script. Justin also aided Andrew, Tiger, and Frank in the overall development, debugging, and training process.

/*
----------A-------------B---------
Assume A is going right and B is going left
The two ants meet at t such that their locations are equal:
A + 1t = B - 1t (since the speed of the ant is 1 unit)
2t = B - A ---> t = (B-A)/2
Ant1 travels (B-A)/2 then all the way back to the beginning (A + (B-A)/2) = B
Ant2 travels (B-A)/2 then all the way back to the end N - (B - (B-A)/2) = N - A
calcuate A such that it is the farthest right ant from the beginning
calculate B such that it is the closest left ant to the end
return the maximum between N - A and B

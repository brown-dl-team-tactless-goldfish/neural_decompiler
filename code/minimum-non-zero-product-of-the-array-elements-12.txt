Input: p = 3
Output: 1512
Explanation: nums = [001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111]
- In the first operation we can swap the leftmost bit of the second and fifth elements.
    - The resulting array is [001, 110, 011, 100, 001, 110, 111].
- In the second operation we can swap the middle bit of the third and fourth elements.
    - The resulting array is [001, 110, 001, 110, 001, 110, 111].
The array product is 1 * 6 * 1 * 6 * 1 * 6 * 7 = 1512, which is the minimum possible product.

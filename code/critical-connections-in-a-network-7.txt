    Nice Explanation:

    https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/bridge-searching.html
    
    
    Idea is that an edge will be bridge if on its removal the remainder gets disconnected, but if the
    remainder portion has a back edge to a vertex that comes before the edge we are considering , then
    it wont be disconnected even if that edge is removed.
    
    a--b---c
    |------|
    
    We we reove a-b edge also, they will be connected because c has a back edge to a. 
    NOTE: the backedge should be <= b to be considered not a bridge edge.

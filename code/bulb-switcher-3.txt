We are toggling the nth bulb that much number of times as much there are factors of it. Thus number i with even number of factors will be off and bulb at number j with odd number of factors will be on.
And only square numbers have odd number of factors. E.g 1(only 1), 4(1,2,4) ,  9(1,3,9), 16(1,2,4,8,16)...and so on...thus we have to find number of perfect squares within n which can be simply reduced to square root of n.

    int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        int i;
        for(i=1; i*i<=n; i++);
        return i-1;
    }

Recurrence relation: 
	Core idea: There are two ways to cover i roads using j skips.
			1. You cover i-1 roads using j skips and don't skip at the previous road. (4)
			2. You cover i roads using j-1 skips and skip the previous road. So you use j-1+1 skip. (4)
	Now, you just need to think about the edge cases like how you would cover i roads without any skip? (2)

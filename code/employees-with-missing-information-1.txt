/*
1) this will select the employees who are in the salary table :

SELECT e.employee_id as employee_id
FROM Employees AS e INNER JOIN Salaries AS s
WHERE e.employee_id=s.employee_id;


2) now we want the column showing if The employee's name is missing or
The employee's salary is missing from the table above :

this will select if the employee's name is missing:
SELECT e.employee_id FROM Employees as e WHERE e.employee_id NOT IN
(SELECT e.employee_id as employee_id
FROM Employees AS e INNER JOIN Salaries AS s
WHERE e.employee_id=s.employee_id) 


this will select if the employee's name is missing:

SELECT s.employee_id FROM Salaries as s WHERE s.employee_id NOT IN
(SELECT e.employee_id as employee_id
FROM Employees AS e INNER JOIN Salaries AS s
WHERE e.employee_id=s.employee_id) ORDER BY employee_id

3) as we want both the values in one column , we 
will take union of the above 2 queries:
*/

SELECT e.employee_id FROM Employees as e WHERE e.employee_id NOT IN
(SELECT e.employee_id as employee_id
FROM Employees AS e INNER JOIN Salaries AS s
WHERE e.employee_id=s.employee_id) 
UNION
SELECT s.employee_id FROM Salaries as s WHERE s.employee_id NOT IN
(SELECT e.employee_id as employee_id
FROM Employees AS e INNER JOIN Salaries AS s
WHERE e.employee_id=s.employee_id) ORDER BY employee_id
